# IJCNN2020_IRC
This repository is for our IJCNN2020 conference paper </br>
"An Input Residual Connection for Simplifying Gated Recurrent Neural Networks".

(1)   Vanilla and IRC RNN language model for PTB</br>

(2)   Mainly built on top of SalesForce's code (SF)</br>
      https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm</br>

(3)   The PTB dataset can be found in many places</br>
      such as</br>
      https://github.com/hjc18/language_modeling_lstm/tree/master/input</br>

(4)   Original results gained from</br>
      PyTorch version 0.4.1.post2</br>
      Not PyTorch version 1.1.0</br>

(5)   Our optimisation-based meta-learning codes will be addressed in
      separate repositories
